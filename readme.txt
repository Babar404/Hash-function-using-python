A telephone directory is to be developed for the employees of an organization to store
following record of each employee:-

Employee Number (5-digit) e.g. 59327
Employee Name
Landline number
Mobile Number

The data is to be stored in a table in main-memory (total employees: 75). The records
need to be inserted as well as searched from the table based on hashing mechanism.
Collisions need to be resolved using suitable technique.
